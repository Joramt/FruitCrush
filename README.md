# FruitCrush

## Intro

FruitCrush is a Candy crush wanna be. As a part of my analyst programmer study, we had to create / develop / manage a project using the HTML5 Canvas technology.

This project should be fully working as is and will no longer be supported*. I think it's a good example of how a duo can auto manage themselves despite the lack of issue tracking & management tool ( Trello / Jira ) with the sole use of a TODO.txt file.

## Future developpement

Lots of good code snippet but also some rework to do. Definitely have to dig in in the partial redraw of certain image when a lot of events are occuring. Also some data persistance could be good ( highcore / username etc. ). Potentially publishing it into the Facebook Game Platform. Also missing some animations.



* this could change in the future ... or this coudldn't.
